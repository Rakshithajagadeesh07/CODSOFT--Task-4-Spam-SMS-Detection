# CODSOFT--Task-4-Spam-SMS-Detection
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting spam SMS messages. Spam detection is critical in filtering out unsolicited, potentially harmful messages that flood usersâ€™ inboxes. This project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques combined with machine learning algorithms to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

### Implementation

1. Data Collection and Exploration
   
The dataset used for this project typically consists of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. 

2. Data Preprocessing
   
Text Cleaning: Removing unwanted characters, symbols, and special characters to standardize the text. This includes eliminating URLs, punctuation, and numbers that do not contribute to detecting spam.
Lowercasing: Converting all text to lowercase to avoid treating words like "FREE" and "free" as different tokens.
Stop Words Removal: Common words like "the," "is," and "in" that do not contribute meaningfully to distinguishing spam from ham are removed.
Tokenization: Breaking down the text into individual words 
Stemming/Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base forms to handle different word variations.

3. Text Vectorization
 
Bag of Words (BoW): Converts the text into a matrix where each row represents a message, and each column represents the frequency of a word in that message.
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): A more refined technique that considers the importance of words in the entire dataset by reducing the weight of commonly occurring words and increasing the weight of rare but significant ones.
Word Embeddings: Advanced techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe, which capture contextual relationships between words, can also be employed for better feature representation.

4. Model Building

Naive Bayes: A popular model for text classification tasks, especially with highly imbalanced data, due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Both Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes variants are tested.
Logistic Regression: A linear model that works well for binary classification tasks such as spam detection.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces.

### Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to detect spam SMS messages. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and various classification algorithms, the project effectively classifies SMS messages as either spam or ham. The preprocessing steps, including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization, prepare the data for accurate and efficient modeling. Multiple machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, were evaluated to identify the most effective approach for spam detection.
